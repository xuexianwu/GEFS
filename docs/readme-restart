Dingchen Hou: 12/13/2018

This is a note about the commit to DHrestart branch, focus on the restart capability
a) The RESTART capabilioty is limited to the forecast job only
b) The gefs_parm file sets the resolution for "hr" and "lr" section as the same C384L64. No change this time
c) The rocoto workflow assumes that the high resolution forecast starts from 0h (cold start or FV3_RELOC)
d) The rocoto workflow assumes that the low resolution forecast starts from 03 (cold start or FV3_RELOC) with RFNdate=NO
e) The above setting is to meet the requirement of GEFS v12 REFORECAST project
f) The general RESTART capability (restart other 03h, restart including the post jobs) are not ready yet, but
   every is encoraged to do exploration

This is a note on how to run forecast job in "restart mode"

To run fv3 forecast job you need to have a set of "restart files" (32 files in total) in the ptmp
~nwges/dev/gefs.YYYYMMDD/00/c00/RESTART directory (c00 is an example of member ID)
The file names are
coupler.res
 fv_core.res.nc
 fv_core.res.tilerN.nc    (N=1,2,..6)
 fv_srf_wnd.res.tileN.nc
 fv_tracer.res.tileN.nc
 phy_data.tileN.nc
 sfc_data.tileN.nc
These files could have prefix to represent the valid time, like "YYYYMMDDCC0000."

To run fv3 forecast in restart mode, I have modified the J-job and the exglobal script

When you want to run "restart" forecast you need to add the following three lines in your 
 rocoto/bin/cray/forecast_high.sh 
     or
 rocoto/bin/cray/forecast_low.sh 

> export RERUN=RESTART  (the J-job script has default value "RERUN"
> export FHINI=03    (forecast lead hour at which your want to restart the fcst)
> export RFNDATE=NO  (If there is prefix in the restart file names, use YES)  

To run restart properly, I had to modify the the fv3 and upp code. Therefore, you have to use the modified version of fv3gfs package in
/gpfs/hps3/emc/ensemble/noscrub/Dingchen.Hou/TAGS/fv3gefs_c550fea3_20181004_ForHong
by changing the $HOMEDIR specification in rocoto/parm/setbase
Xianwu should work with Bing to build this version on DELL.
Bing can add more chages to the FV3 code.

Two most obvious issues exist now:
1) We can not output the f03 (beginning of restart) nemsio files now, but Bing already has a fix.
2) When 2 different output frequency are used (with FHOUTHF and FHOUTLF), the LF part files can not be written out. Bing is looking into this issue.

I have tested the scripts for "hr" section
In the reforecat project, we will run the "hr" fcst with the above three lines.
Xianwu will test the branch to make sure it works for different situations, before merging it to master.
