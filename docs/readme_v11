Additional Notes on running GEFS v11
This note should be used in addition to that in the readme file.


This note should be used in addition to that in the readme file.

1. Added ecf sub directory
   The files in this new sub directory is the ecflow scripts used in production.
   The job cards genetaed bt the control/setup_job_card.wcoss should be functionally identical  to these ecflow scripts, especially in the resources requirement.

2. Added gempak sub directory to support the GEMPAK jobs

3. Added  parm/gefs_awip sub-sub directory to support GEFS_WAFS job

4. Added GEMPAK (5) jobs, 5 J-job scripts and 4 exgefs*.ecf scripts

5. Added JGEFS_WAFS job, 1 J-job, 1 exgefs*ecf script and 2 ush scripts

6. Setting up the package
   After  copying this directory to "(your file location)/[expid]/nwdev" (see step 1 in readme file), you need to do the following:
   (1) see parm/gefs_config to make sure the following modules and  tags are available:
       /nwprod2/modulefiles
       prod_util/v1.0.1
       util_shared/v1.0.0
       grib_util/v1.0.1

       HOMEgsm=$HOMEDIR/gsm.v12.1.0
       HOMEpost=$HOMEDIR/ncep_post.v5.1.1
       HOMEenkf=$HOMEDIR/enkf.v2.0.1
       HOMEtrak=$HOMEDIR/ens_tracker.v1.1.0
   (2) build the  executables of GEFS
       go to the sorc sub-directory, following the instructions in README.build file, all the executables will be generated and saved in the exec sub-directory. 

3. Starting your dev run, on wcoss 
    Please check and modify (if it is necessaray) the control/setbase scrip, to make sure the paths of the source and output files are correct.
    Many dev users run GEFS in such a way: one fixed cycle per day (e.g. 00Z),  using pre-generated init files, ignoring gfs deterministic fcst products. In this situation, one needs to modify the following scripts:
    (1) control/gefsrun_T574, uncomment line 879 (jjjb=100)
    (2) control/control.r000, change the if condition in line 13 from ( 1 == 0 ) to ( 0 == 0), and modify line 23 and 37 to specify the path of your init files
    (3) parm/gefs.parm, uncomment line 26 to make sure fhrp=24
